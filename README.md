qKMeansClusterExtension
=======================
This is the QlikView Extension that is can be used to talk to R.  By default, the extensio is configured to talk to my R script which is hosted on github.  However, the location can be modified so that it can be used on a local instance of openCPU.  The extension uses a few external js libraries which is in the extension.
